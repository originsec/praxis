# Semantic Operations

Semantic operations are predefined tasks that run through AI agents. You define what you want to happen in natural language, and Praxis handles the execution.

## What's a Semantic Operation?

An operation is a task specification:

- **Name** - Identifier for the operation
- **Prompt** - What you want the agent to do
- **Mode** - How to execute (one-shot or agent)
- **Timeout** - How long to wait
- **YOLO Mode** - Auto-approve actions

Think of operations as reusable prompts with execution settings.

## Execution Modes

### One-Shot Mode

Sends a single prompt to the agent and waits for a response.

How it works:
1. Create a session (if needed)
2. Send the operation prompt
3. Wait for the agent to respond
4. Return the response
5. Close the session (if we created it)

Best for: Simple tasks, single actions, quick checks.

### Agent Mode

Uses an orchestrating LLM to run multi-turn interactions with the target agent.

How it works:
1. Orchestrator LLM receives the operation prompt
2. Orchestrator generates a prompt for the target agent
3. Target agent responds
4. Orchestrator evaluates and decides next action
5. Loop continues until complete or max iterations reached

Best for: Complex tasks, multi-step operations, tasks requiring judgment.

The orchestrator is a separate LLM (configured in Settings as "Semantic Ops" LLM) that manages the interaction. It has access to a `session_prompt` tool to communicate with the target agent.

## Creating Operations

Operations are stored in the library:

1. Go to **Operations** → **Library** tab
2. Click **New Operation**
3. Fill in the details:
   - Name and description
   - Operation prompt
   - Mode (one-shot or agent)
   - Timeout value
   - YOLO mode setting
4. Save

Operations are stored in the database and available across sessions.

## Running Operations

### From the Library

1. Go to **Operations** → **Library**
2. Find the operation
3. Click **Run**
4. Select node and agent
5. Watch execution in the Runs tab

### From an Agent

1. Open an agent's detail page
2. Go to the **Ops** tab
3. Click **Run Operation**
4. Select from available operations

## Monitoring Execution

The Runs tab shows all running and completed operations:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Operation being executed |
| Node/Agent | Where it's running |
| Status | Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled |
| Started | When execution began |

Click a run to see details:
- Full execution output
- Iteration history (agent mode)
- Final result or error

## Operation Output

Each operation produces output:

**One-shot mode** - The agent's response to your prompt.

**Agent mode** - Full transcript of the orchestrator's iterations:
- Prompts sent to target agent
- Responses received
- Orchestrator's reasoning
- Final result

## Built-in Operations

Praxis comes with some predefined operations for common tasks. You can use these as-is or as templates for your own.

## YOLO Mode in Operations

When YOLO mode is enabled for an operation:
- The target agent session is created with auto-approve
- Actions execute without user confirmation
- The entire operation runs hands-off

This is useful for automated scenarios but removes safety checks.

## Model Override

Operations can specify a different model than the default:
- Override the Semantic Ops LLM for specific operations
- Use faster models for simple operations
- Use more capable models for complex tasks

## Cancellation

Running operations can be cancelled:
1. Find the operation in Runs
2. Click **Cancel**
3. The operation terminates

Cancellation is best-effort-if the agent is mid-action, that action may complete.

## Timeouts

Each operation has a timeout:
- One-shot: Time to wait for agent response
- Agent mode: Total time for all iterations

When timeout is reached, the operation fails with a timeout error.

## Chaining Operations

Operations can be combined into chains for complex workflows. See the [Chains](chains.md) section.

## Troubleshooting

### Operation stuck

- Check if YOLO mode should be enabled
- Verify the agent session is responsive
- Try a simpler prompt

### Unexpected results

- Review the full output
- Check if the prompt is clear enough
- Consider using agent mode for complex tasks

### Timeouts

- Increase the timeout value
- Simplify the operation
- Check if the agent is responding at all
